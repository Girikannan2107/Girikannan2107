Girikannan M P
Software Engineer | Real-Time Systems | AI & Distributed Architecture

I am a software engineer focused on building scalable, real-time, and AI-powered systems. My work centers around event-driven architectures, distributed streaming platforms, and intelligent backend systems that combine modern infrastructure with machine learning and large language models.

I specialize in designing microservices that process live data streams, apply predictive logic, and expose production-ready APIs. My projects emphasize clean architecture principles, modular design, and deployment-ready infrastructure.

Highlight Project
Intelligent Streaming Architecture for Financial Market Decision Support

A real-time, AI-powered financial intelligence system built using Kafka, Pathway, FastAPI, and OpenAI GPT. The platform ingests live market and news data, processes events in real time, generates predictive insights, and enhances decision-making using contextual AI reasoning.

Architecture features include:

Event-driven microservices

Real-time streaming computation

Agent-based prediction system

GPT-powered contextual intelligence layer

Fully containerized deployment

Clean architecture and modular structure

Engineering Philosophy

I believe in building systems that are:

Scalable by design

Modular and maintainable

Environment-driven and secure

Strongly typed and testable

Designed for production readiness

My goal is to create systems that combine infrastructure robustness with intelligent reasoning capabilities.

Current Focus

Advanced real-time stream processing

AI-enhanced backend systems

Production-grade microservice architecture

Scalable RAG implementations
